# Sublime-EncodingConvert

Reopen the current file and convert from whatever encoding you like to `UTF-8`. As `@kingkeith` pointed out, for some reason Sublime is unable to add more encoding in the `Reopen with Encoding` dialog. 

## Usage

At this moment I've add only two command palatte, for the `GBK` and `BIG5` encoding. The usage is as straightforward as the following screenshot:

List of supported command palatte:

```
Reopen: convert from GBK to UTF8
Reopen: convert from BIG5 to UTF8
```

## Development

To be added.
