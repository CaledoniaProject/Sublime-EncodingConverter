# Sublime-EncodingConvert

Reopen the current file and convert from whatever encoding you like to `UTF-8`. Sublime is unable to add more encoding in the `Reopen with Encoding` dialog. So fuck it.

## Usage

At this moment I've add only two source encodings: `GBK` and `BIG5`. Feel free to add more to the list and submit a pull request
