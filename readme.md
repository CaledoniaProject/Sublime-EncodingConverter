# Sublime-EncodingConvert

Reopen the current file and convert from whatever encoding you like to `UTF-8`. As `@kingkeith` pointed out, for some reason Sublime is unable to add more encoding in the `Reopen with Encoding` dialog.

## Usage

At this moment I've add only two source encodings: `GBK` and `BIG5`. The usage is as obvious as the following screenshot
